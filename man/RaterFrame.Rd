\title{Create a Data.frame for Interrater Agreement
}
\description{ Creates a \code{data.frame} for a formula  \code{rating ~ subjects | raters}
with the subjects in rows and the raters in columns as base structure for 
IRA functions.
}
\usage{
RaterFrame(formula, data, subset, na.action, incl.subj = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{something like \code{rating ~ subjects | raters}}
  \item{data}{ the data }
  \item{subset}{ potential subset}
  \item{na.action}{what should happen with missings}
  \item{incl.subj}{logical, should the subject column be included (default \code{TRUE}) }
}
\details{Assessments made by raters are typically—and appropriately—stored 
and organized in databases. Data originating from databases are usually in 
long format. Converting this long format into a wide format suitable for 
analysis is a complex task. The present function supports this process by 
converting long-format data into a wide format that can be used by subsequent 
inter-rater agreement functions. Missing values are marked as \code{NAs}.
