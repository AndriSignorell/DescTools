\usage{
GwetAC1(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  conf.level = 0.95,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{For the default method: an \eqn{n \times m} matrix (or data.frame)
of ratings where rows are subjects and columns are raters. Entries are
nominal categories (factor, character, or integers); \code{NA} allowed.}

\item{y}{For the default method: an \eqn{n \times m} matrix (or data.frame)
of ratings where rows are subjects and columns are raters. Entries are
nominal categories (factor, character, or integers); \code{NA} allowed.}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for the interval (default \code{0.95}).}

\item{ci.type}{Type of confidence interval: one of
\code{"none"}, \code{"asymptotic"} (delta method), or \code{"bootstrap"}.}

\item{out}{either \code{"def"} or \code{"ext"} defining the set of results.
If \code{"def"} is selected, only the value of the statistic is
returned, supplemented with the confidence interval
if necessary. If the argument is set to \code{"ext"}, an
extended result set with various intermediate results is returned.}

\item{...}{Further arguments are passed to \code{BootCI()}  to control
type and parameters of the bootstrap confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"htest"} with elements:
\item{statistic}{Named numeric: \code{AC1}.}
\item{estimate}{Named vector with \code{Po} (observed agreement) and
\code{Pe} (expected agreement).}
\item{parameter}{Named vector with \code{subjects} and \code{raters.eff}
(average number of valid ratings per subject).}
\item{conf.int}{Confidence interval for AC1 if requested.}
\item{method}{Method string.}
\item{data.name}{Description of the data.}
}
\description{
Computes Gwet's AC1 agreement coefficient for \emph{m >= 2} raters
and nominal categories, allowing missing ratings. The default method
accepts a subject-by-rater rating matrix or as alternative two vectors.
Use formula interface \code{y ~ id | rater}
(long format) via \code{\link{RaterFrame}()}.

It returns Gwet's AC1 along with an optional confidence interval based on
(i) an asymptotic delta-method variance or (ii) nonparametric bootstrap
over subjects.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{n} be the number of subjects and \eqn{m_s} the number of valid
ratings for subject \eqn{s}. For each subject, the observed pairwise
agreement is
\deqn{A_s = \frac{\sum_c {n_{sc} \choose 2}}{ {m_s \choose 2} },}
where \eqn{n_{sc}} is the number of raters assigning category \eqn{c} to
subject \eqn{s}. The overall observed agreement is
\eqn{P_o = \frac{1}{n}\sum_s A_s}.

Let \eqn{p_c} denote the overall prevalence of category \eqn{c} across all
ratings (all raters and subjects), and
\eqn{P_e = \sum_c p_c(1-p_c)}. Then Gwet's AC1 for multiple raters is
\deqn{AC1 = \frac{P_o - P_e}{1 - P_e}.}

For the asymptotic variance, we use a subject-level delta-method:
define the subject contribution vector
\eqn{g_s = \big(A_s,\ n_{s1}/\bar m,\dots,n_{sK}/\bar m\big)^\top},
where \eqn{\bar m} is the average number of ratings per subject and
\eqn{K} is the number of categories. The empirical covariance of
\eqn{g_s} yields (via delta-method) an estimate of \eqn{Var(AC1)}.

Bootstrap CIs resample subjects with replacement.
