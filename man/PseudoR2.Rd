  %%  ~~function to do ... ~~

\description{Although there's no commonly accepted agreement on how to assess the fit of a logistic regression, there are some approaches. The goodness of fit of the logistic regression model can be expressed by some variants of pseudo R squared statistics, most of which being based on the deviance of the model.
  %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\details{Cox and Snell's \eqn{R^2} is based on the log likelihood for the model compared to the log likelihood for a baseline model. However, with categorical outcomes, it has a theoretical maximum value of less than 1, even for a "perfect" model.

  Nagelkerke's \eqn{R^2} (also sometimes called Cragg-Uhler) is an adjusted version of the Cox and Snell's \eqn{R^2} that adjusts the scale of the statistic to cover the full range from 0 to 1.

  McFadden's \eqn{R^2} is another version, based on the log-likelihood kernels for the intercept-only model and the full estimated model.

Veall and Zimmermann concluded that from a set of six widely used measures the measure suggested by McKelvey and Zavoina had the closest correspondance to ordinary least square R2. The Aldrich-Nelson pseudo-R2 with the Veall-Zimmermann correction is the best approximation of the McKelvey-Zavoina pseudo-R2. Efron, Aldrich-Nelson, McFadden and Nagelkerke approaches severely underestimate the "true R2".
