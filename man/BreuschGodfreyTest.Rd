\usage{
BreuschGodfreyTest(
  formula,
  order = 1,
  order.by = NULL,
  type = c("Chisq", "F"),
  data = list(),
  fill = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a symbolic description for the model to be tested (or a
fitted \code{"lm"} object).}

\item{order}{integer. maximal order of serial correlation to be tested.}

\item{order.by}{Either a vector \code{z} or a formula with a single
explanatory variable like \code{~ z}. The observations in the model are
ordered by the size of \code{z}. If set to \code{NULL} (the default) the
observations are assumed to be ordered (e.g., a time series).}

\item{type}{the type of test statistic to be returned. Either \code{"Chisq"}
for the Chi-squared test statistic or \code{"F"} for the F test statistic.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the model. By
default the variables are taken from the environment which
\code{BreuschGodfreyTest} is called from.}

\item{fill}{starting values for the lagged residuals in the auxiliary
regression. By default \code{0} but can also be set to \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"BreuschGodfreyTest"} inheriting from
\code{"htest"} containing the following components: \item{statistic}{the
value of the test statistic.} \item{p.value}{the p-value of the test.}
\item{parameter}{degrees of freedom.} \item{method}{a character string
indicating what type of test was performed.} \item{data.name}{a character
string giving the name(s) of the data.} \item{coefficients}{coefficient
estimates from the auxiliary regression.} \item{vcov}{corresponding
covariance matrix estimate.}
}
\description{
\code{BreuschGodfreyTest} performs the Breusch-Godfrey test for higher-order
serial correlation.
}
\details{
Under \eqn{H_0} the test statistic is asymptotically Chi-squared with
degrees of freedom as given in \code{parameter}.  If \code{type} is set to
\code{"F"} the function returns a finite sample version of the test
statistic, employing an \eqn{F} distribution with degrees of freedom as
given in \code{parameter}.

By default, the starting values for the lagged residuals in the auxiliary
regression are chosen to be 0 (as in Godfrey 1978) but could also be set to
\code{NA} to omit them.

\code{BreuschGodfreyTest} also returns the coefficients and estimated
covariance matrix from the auxiliary regression that includes the lagged
residuals.  Hence, \code{CoefTest} (package: RegClassTools) can be used to
inspect the results. (Note, however, that standard theory does not always
apply to the standard errors and t-statistics in this regression.)
}
\note{
This function was previously published as \code{bgtest} in the
\pkg{lmtest} package and has been integrated here without logical changes.

\examples{

## Generate a stationary and an AR(1) series
x <- rep(c(1, -1), 50)

y1 <- 1 + x + rnorm(100)

## Perform Breusch-Godfrey test for first-order serial correlation:
BreuschGodfreyTest(y1 ~ x)

## or for fourth-order serial correlation
BreuschGodfreyTest(y1 ~ x, order = 4)

## Compare with Durbin-Watson test results:
DurbinWatsonTest(y1 ~ x)

y2 <- stats::filter(y1, 0.5, method = "recursive")
BreuschGodfreyTest(y2 ~ x)
