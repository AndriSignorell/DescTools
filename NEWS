    negative values. This was promised so in the help file, but never delivered.
    (Credits to David R. Weise)
  * StrExtractBetween() would have rejected to extract parts between two identical
    characters.
  * Quantile(), and in consequence Median(), would not have treated missings correctly.

    (which is likely to be remarkable for a numeric variable).

BUGFIXES:
  * PseudoR2() will work with negative binomial models again.
  * Untable would not have returned the expected results in some combinations 
    of column names. (Credits to Vilmantas Gegzna for detecting this issue)

  * PseudoR2() is using reformulate() instead of update() in order to improve
    interoperability within the tidyverse, especially support tibbles created 
    by purr::map. (Credits to Inferrator)
  * ConvUnit() will now convert time units to weeks and vice versa.
  * AUC() gains new arguments according to its original version in package MESS.
    (Credits to Claus Ekstrom and Tatiana Lust)

    (credits to Chirok Han).

DEPRECATED:
  * FileOpenCmd(), SaveAsDlg(), ModelDlg(), ColPicker(), ColorDlg(),
    ImportFileDlg(), PlotPar(), PlotMar(), PlotPch(), SelectVarDlg(), Xplore()
    have been transferred to the package DescToolsAddIns, as these functions
    presumably only make sense in a GUI context.

   * PlotBinTree() would not have placed the text correctly in the horizontal
     representation.
   * Str() would not have passed ... args to str, as stated in help.

     and a userdefined order was desired.

DEFUNCT:
   * Date() was needless, as ISODate does the same job.
   * Exec(x), consisting out of eval(parse(text=x)) did not contain enough
     functionality to justify an own function.
   * Same applies to AddClass() and RemoveClass().

     because of the named argument. (Credits to Tomas Kalibera)
   * TOne() would have mixed up footnote signs for numeric tests.
   * Hmean() returned 1/mean(x) instead 1/mean(1/x) since 0.99.18. (Credits to

   * HosmerLemeshowTest used for testing glms has been integrated.
   * GeomTrans() can be used to transform a geometric structure by translating,

   * Trim will not longer return a sorted vector. The indices of the trimmed values
     will now be returned in an attribute "trim".
   * Rotate accepts xy.coords and returns the same class (instead of a list).
   * Rotate will choose the centroid of the given polygon instead of the fixed
     point (0,0) and gets a new argument allowing to define the aspect ratio.
   * DrawRegPolygon returns a xy.coords object instead of a list.
   * PlotLinesA will use lines instead of usr coordinates for placing the
     legend text. The distance of line segements can now be controlled in more
     detail.
   * DescToolsOptions have been fundamentally reorganized, as they were grown
     organically and organized chaotically (for not saying: not organized at all ...).
     See ?DescToolsOptions for all the details.
     "fixedfont" must now be defined as list, "footnote", "col" are now vectors instead
     single values and formats (fmt) are organized as list. (see also new function Fmt()).

   * Hmean() and Gmean() get an option for calculating confidence intervals.
   * lines.Lc for plotting Lorenz curve gets a CI-option.
   * StrDist gets an ignore.case argument.

     Kendall Tau-B, Somers Delta and Stuart Tau-C, will run much faster
     with a O(n log(n)) implementation (as long as no CIs are needed).
   * IsDichotomous gets a new argument strict for checking for strictly two levels
     and a na.rm argument, which is set to FALSE by default.


BUGFIXES:
   * PairApply simply overwrote the diagonal with 1, which was inappropriate.
     Functions are now also evaluated for diagonal elements.
   * TOne would not have displayed column names, in case there were only
     boolean variables in the data.frame to describe. (credits to Beat Bruengger)
   * CombN used a wrong formula for the number of permutions with no
     repetitions respecting order. (credits to Carlos Redondo-Figuero)
   * PlotDot erroneously reversed the order of datapoints, when simultaneously
     supplied with group data and error bars.
   * TOne would not have displayed variables with just one unique value.

DEFUNCT:
   * The data.frame interface for Label was ambiguous. A data.frame is now
     treated like any other object.
   * SetLabel made no longer sense, since Label and `Label<-` had been defined.
   * ImportDlg has been renamed to FileOpenCmd as it had nothing to do with import
     of data.
   * WrdText has definitely been replaced by ToWrd.
   * WrdR has always been a code study and has been removed.

     now be FALSE by default.
   * PlotFdist gets a new argument args.curve.ecdf allowing to superpose
     a function to the ecdf-plot.
   * PlotFdist's default argument for the bw of the density curve changes to
     bw = "SJ", which turns out to be the better default for n < 1000.
   * Large and Small have been recoded in C++ (thanks to Nathan Russel) to run
     faster and get a renamed argument (na.last instead of na.rm).
     So far they are supposed be the fastest on the market...
   * PartCor has been renamed to CorPart, as it can be better found with that name.
   * Format gets a new format code "eng" for engineering format.
   * StrDist gets an additional method "normalized levensthein".
   * PlotMultiDens gets an additional parameter fill for coloring the areas.
   * PlotWeb gets a lwd argument for defining freely the lined widths.
   * In Recode the argument newlevels is replaced by the dots argument. This
     is the same rationale as in Rename.

   * Numerous updates in help files.

BUGFIXES:
   * Desc for variables with only one value won't raise an error any more.

     arguments are now being recycled.
   * RoundM has been renamed to RoundTo.
   * PlotRCol has been renamed to ColPicker and gets a new argument "locator".
   * Desc has been conceptually rewritten to follow clearer S3 class design and
     to be more consistent in the arguments (while improving performance).
     A print and a plot method are now available. PlotDesc(x) has
     therefore been replaced by plot(Desc(x)).
     (I fear this has the potential to break your code, I apologise for that ...)
   * The class interfaces .default, .formula etc. are by default not exported anymore.
     This applies to the function PageTest, LeveneTest, JonckheereTerpstraTest,
     CochranTest, HotellingsT2Test, DunnTest, DunnetTest, MosesTest, NemenyiTest,
     PostHocTest, YuenTTest, ZTest, SignTest, RunsTest, ScheffeTest,
     MeanDiffCI, Format, Label, Rev, Sort, PercTable, Lc, EtaSq, PlotArea,

     to "two-sided".
   * MeanCI, MedianCI and VarCI get a new argument "sides" for one sided confidence intervals.
   * PlotFdist displays the mean and its confidence intervall by default in the boxplot.
   * BarnardTest and BartelsRankTest have other alternative options.

BUGFIXES:
   * Documentation of GoodmanKruskalTau cited the wrong formula.
   * Corrected gcc-UBSAN issue with big integers in GCD.
   * PlotDot mistakenly reversed the order of labels, when defined as vector and did not
     handle groups correctly.
   * Hmean reported an error, when supplied with a NA vector, instead of simply
     returning NA and shut up.
   * Desc.numeric would not always have sorted the whole vector, which in some cases
     resulted in incorrect unique and extreme values.
   * StrAlign would not alwas have trimmed white space on the right side.

KNOWN PROBLEMS / TODOS:
   * Leading zeros and big.mark can not be used together in Format.
   * DoCounts should get an O(n log(n)) implementation, containig std. errors.
   * We have not reached our goal yet - documentation is still not finalized, some functions
     not tested thoroughly enough, others have rather a proof of concept status -
     but we are well on our way to achieving it. Systematic check over all
     function interfaces, ensuring consistency with R-standards and DescTools
     conventions will be performed next.

   * Desc.table will now report ChiSquare test results with cont. correction
     only for 2x2 tables (and without contcorr for rxc tables) by default.
   * Desc.table gains a conf.level argument, allowing to pass that to OddsRatio, Assocs etc.
   * DescNumNum will only display the given function y ~ x anymore (leaving out x ~ y).
     The smoother can now be set to "loess"" or to "spline".
   * PlotDesc.table will interpret col1, col2 as a vector of colors for the two mosaics,
     instead of two colors spanning a color ramp.
   * MarginTable has been renamed to Margins, to delimit it from margin.table.

   * HuberM gets a new interface, hiding some technical arguments and adding the option
     for confidence intervals.

     yet implemented.

BUGFIXES:
   * Bug in CohenD fixed.
   * ColorLegend would erroneously have reversed the colour labels.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * Min has been renamed to Minute and Sec to Second.
   * Hour, Minute, Second do accept POSIXct times now.
   * CorCI loses the argument *twotailed* and gains the argument *alternative*.
     This is following the logic in other test- and CI-functions.
   * Assocs has been redesigned to run faster (but it still has accelerating potential..)
   * Untable has been extended to support frequency form of tables (a data.frame
     with levels of the factors and a "Freq" column).
   * XLGetRange returns the full call statement as attribute.
   * OddsRatio will be calculated as log OR instead of simple OR, allowing bigger n.
     (Well, David Meyer has been there long before, as I noticed lately...)
   * AddMonths accepts a vector of dates.
   * Trim accepts integer values on the argument trim. The function returns NA instead
     of median(x), if trim is set to a value > 0.5, resp. n/2.

   * Lorenz curve function Lc gains a formula interface for creating groupwise curves.
   * PlotBubble gains a formula interface and some more arguments, e.g. args.legend.
   * Mround has been renamed to RoundM, and gains a new argument FUN which allows

   * MeanCI has been enhanced to calculate confidence intervals for trimmed means.
   * StrVal gains two new arguments paste and as.numeric.
   * Many smaller changes on the documentation and helpfiles.
   * PairApply argument "symmetric" gets another default value: "FALSE" instead of "TRUE".
     This seems more robust, as the other way round potential errors are more likely.


DEFUNCT:
   * WhichNumerics, WhichFactors, WhichFlags are not needed anymore.
     which(sapply(x, IsNumeric)), sapply(x, IsDichotmous), sapply(x, is.factor) do the job.
   * DescFactFact is a relict and obsolete. Use of Desc.formula or Desc.table is recommended.
   * FormatFix and FormatSig have been replaced by the new function Format.
   * Explore has been removed because of its dependency for the package "manipulate"
     (which is not on CRAN). It might be added again built on tcltk down the road.


BUGFIXES:
   * plotit was not correctly interpreted in Desc.factor (credits to Thomas Schlesinger).
   * PlotVenn did not correctly place the figures in the 2-sample case (credits to Andrew Marritt).
