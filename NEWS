DescTools 0.99.55 (2024-07-26)
------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
  * NZ() returns all non zero elements from a numeric vector.
  * BrierScoreCI(), CstatCI(), RSqCI() return bootstrap confidence intervals
    for the BrierScore, the C-Statistic and the R squared of a linear model.
 
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
  * MeanCIn() displays a warning if the required width of the confidence 
    interval exceeds the standard deviation.
  * ToWrd.table() gets another default for row.names. It now is TRUE instead
    of FALSE as before.
  * OddsRatio.glm changes its argument use.profile's default from TRUE to FALSE.
  * MedianCI() allows further bootstrap types, dots arguments are now 
    passed on to the bootstrap procedure. The argument R has been removed, 
    but can still be provided in the dots. Default type for boostrap is 
    no longer 'basic' but 'perc', which seems better suited for the median.
    (See discussion with MrJerryTAO in 
    https://github.com/AndriSignorell/DescTools/issues/109)
  * Some first helpfiles are generated by roxygen2 now.  
  * The arguments in Winsorize() have been condensed to a single one with  
    extended flexibility. 
  * Closest() vectorizes the value to be found (argument "a") and "which".
  * Unwhich() checks its arguments now and got a default value for the argument n.
  * TOne() gets an improved print routine.
  * BrierScore() checks the input arguments.
  * TukeyBiweight() has been rewritten in C++ and now runs twice as fast 
    as before.

BUGFIXES:
  * The text for prop.diff will be displayed in Desc.table().
  * Custom xlab and ylab values can be used in plot.Desc.factfact().
  * MultinomCI() did not correctly set the left/right side intervalls to 0 for 
    single sided intervals.
  * ToWide() now handles factors with more than three levels without warning.  

DEPRECATED:
  * Arrow() has been moved to the package DescToolsAddIns.

  * as.Date.ym() converts a yearmonth to a date.
  * NALevel() allows to quickly define an alternative level for NAs in a factor.
  * CutAge() is a convenient wrapper for cutting age variables in slices 
    of e.g. 10 years.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
  * Year(), Month() now also extract the parts from a yearmonth representation.
  * Hodges-Lehman now uses long-longs instead of integers, allowing larger vectors.
  * AddMonthsYM() has been integrated in AddMonths(). Use AddMonths(as.ym(202402)) 
    instead.
  * The Desc() procedure now puts the response in columns instead in rows as up to now
    in the case of two factor variables. So the resulting table is transposed compared
    to before.
  * The Desc() procedure for 2x2 tables includes a confidence interval for 
    the difference of proportions based on BinomDiffCI(..., method="mn").

BUGFIXES:
  * The documentation of RelRisk() did not correspond to the code.

    p estimator for the Agresti-Coull confidence intervall.
    As a replacement for this, there is a argument std_est with 
    which the method specific non-standard point estimator can be returned.
    (Thanks to julienbio99, MrJerryTAO and Vilmantas for the
    research and discussion)
  * VarTest() gets a more exact calculation for twosided p values
    in the case of the one sample test.

  * SplitToDummy() for splitting a string vector and create a dummy code matrix.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
  * CochranArmitageTest has been updated to use scores instead of ordinal values only.

    instead of c("two.sided", "increasing", "decreasing"), which were poorly defined.
  * BoxedText gains a formula interface.  
  * RevCode takes dots now, for reverse numeric codes.

    meaning within the function body. 
  * PlotCorr() now displays the matrix in the same form, as it is defined.
    x is internally transposed.
  * In Desc.table() the Phi coefficient has been replaced by Kendall Tau-B.

    CramerV, which is also reported by default, has the same value.
  * CourseData() will open xl-datafiles containing a description tab and 
    define factors based on this information, as well as set labels.

    which was documented, but not implemented.
  * PlotCorr() mislabeled the legend when breaks were specified (Credits for the
    fix to Duncan Murdoch).  
  * Several replacements of T with TRUE, which have apparently always 
    slipped through until now. (Again, the credit goes to Duncan Murdoch.)

  * MeanCIn() gives the required samplesize to obtain a confidence interval 
    of a given width.
  * Rank() is added at the expense of DenseRank() using a fast implementation in 
    data.table, that allows ranking based on multiple columns. 
  * %::% does the same as %:% but in greedy mode, say using the last match instead
    of the first one.

  * StrExtractBetween() would have rejected to extract parts between two identical
    characters.
  * Quantile(), and in consequence Median(), would not have treated missings correctly.

    be consistent with the rest of the word bookmark functions.
  * TOne()'s "fmt.pval" argument has been replaced with the more general 
    "fmt", which allows to define formats for counts, numbers, percentages 
    AND p-values.
  * SplitPath() gets a further information "fullpath".  
  * StrTrunc() gets two new arguments "ellipsis" and can truncate strings
    on word boundaries with "useWordBoundaries".

  * plot.TMod() allows to provide a terms list for plotting.    

BUGFIXES:
  * Cramer's V bias correction is corrected (hmm...).
  * TMod() supports single models now.




DescTools 0.99.31 (2019-12-21)
------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
  * WrdUpdateFields() can be used to update fields in a Word document.
  * Mgp() does the same for axis title, labels and line as Mar() does
    for the margins.
  * PlotPairs() is a more specific pairs() variant. 
  * IQRw() supports weights for calculating the interquartile range.

DEPRECATED:
  * PlotDev() X was both a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to rid the analysis
    code of superfluous technical reporting code. The new approach uses meta-code
    together with ToWrdWithBookmark(), which does not require any changes to 
    the original code. As a result, PlotDev() has been removed.

DescTools 0.99.24 (2018-03-19)
------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:

  * Append() is used to append elements to a vector, rows/columns to a matrix
    and columns to a data.frame in the in the same sense as append().

    NAs if the argument has not been set.
  * Gmean will return 0 if any element of x is zero now.
  * Desc.character would not have passed the plots when output to MS-Word.

DEFUNCT:

     and a userdefined order was desired.

DEFUNCT:
   * Date() was needless, as ISODate does the same job.
   * Exec(x), consisting out of eval(parse(text=x)) did not contain enough
     functionality to justify an own function.
   * Same applies to AddClass() and RemoveClass().
   * ClipToVect() read the clipboard and printed the enquoted content.
     This operation is implemented in DescToolsAddIns::Enquote() resulting in
     a more usable approach.
   * LogLin() has been integrated in LogSt() with an option for the base.
   * LogGen is not needed anymore.

   * HosmerLemeshowTest used for testing glms has been integrated.
   * GeomTrans() can be used to transform a geometric structure by translating,
     scaling and rotating.
   * Basic linear modeling functions VIF() and StdCoef() have been added.


UPDATED FUNCTIONS:

   * Rotate will choose the centroid of the given polygon instead of the fixed
     point (0,0) and gets a new argument allowing to define the aspect ratio.
   * DrawRegPolygon returns a xy.coords object instead of a list.
   * PlotLinesA will use lines instead of usr coordinates for placing the
     legend text. The distance of line segements can now be controlled in more
     detail.
   * DescToolsOptions have been fundamentally reorganized, as they were grown
     organically and organized chaotically (for not saying: not organized at all ...).
     See ?DescToolsOptions for all the details.
     "fixedfont" must now be defined as list, "footnote", "col" are now vectors instead
     single values and formats (fmt) are organized as list. (see also new function Fmt()).

     with a O(n log(n)) implementation (as long as no CIs are needed).
   * IsDichotomous gets a new argument strict for checking for strictly two levels
     and a na.rm argument, which is set to FALSE by default.


BUGFIXES:
   * PairApply simply overwrote the diagonal with 1, which was inappropriate.
     Functions are now also evaluated for diagonal elements.
   * TOne would not have displayed column names, in case there were only
     boolean variables in the data.frame to describe. (credits to Beat Bruengger)
   * CombN used a wrong formula for the number of permutions with no
     repetitions respecting order. (credits to Carlos Redondo-Figuero)

     supplied with group data and error bars.
   * TOne would not have displayed variables with just one unique value.

DEFUNCT:

     treated like any other object.
   * SetLabel made no longer sense, since Label and `Label<-` had been defined.
   * ImportDlg has been renamed to FileOpenCmd as it had nothing to do with import
     of data.
   * WrdText has definitely been replaced by ToWrd.
   * WrdR has always been a code study and has been removed.

     a function to the ecdf-plot.
   * PlotFdist's default argument for the bw of the density curve changes to
     bw = "SJ", which turns out to be the better default for n < 1000.
   * Large and Small have been recoded in C++ (thanks to Nathan Russel) to run
     faster and get a renamed argument (na.last instead of na.rm).
     So far they are supposed be the fastest on the market...
   * PartCor has been renamed to CorPart, as it can be better found with that name.
   * Format gets a new format code "eng" for engineering format.
   * StrDist gets an additional method "normalized levensthein".
   * PlotMultiDens gets an additional parameter fill for coloring the areas.
   * PlotWeb gets a lwd argument for defining freely the lined widths.

   * Numerous updates in help files.

BUGFIXES:
   * Desc for variables with only one value won't raise an error any more.

   * Several corrections and adaptations to the help files.
   * GoodmanKruskalTauA has been renamed to the more specific GoodmanKruskalTau.
   * StrAlign gets a new interface for left, right and center alignment. See help.
   * AddMonths has been splitted in two: AddMonths (for dates) and AddMonthsYM for integers.

     arguments are now being recycled.
   * RoundM has been renamed to RoundTo.
   * PlotRCol has been renamed to ColPicker and gets a new argument "locator".
   * Desc has been conceptually rewritten to follow clearer S3 class design and
     to be more consistent in the arguments (while improving performance).
     A print and a plot method are now available. PlotDesc(x) has
     therefore been replaced by plot(Desc(x)).
     (I fear this has the potential to break your code, I apologise for that ...)
   * The class interfaces .default, .formula etc. are by default not exported anymore.
     This applies to the function PageTest, LeveneTest, JonckheereTerpstraTest,
     CochranTest, HotellingsT2Test, DunnTest, DunnetTest, MosesTest, NemenyiTest,
     PostHocTest, YuenTTest, ZTest, SignTest, RunsTest, ScheffeTest,
     MeanDiffCI, Format, Label, Rev, Sort, PercTable, Lc, EtaSq, PlotArea,

   * StrRight and StrLeft will accept negative n number of characters for cutting
     characters either right or left.
   * ToWide can now merge several parts of a data.frame by a key.
   * PlotLines gain new arguments pch, pch.col, etc. for superposing points.

BUGFIXES:
   * Documentation of GoodmanKruskalTau cited the wrong formula.

   * PlotDot mistakenly reversed the order of labels, when defined as vector and did not
     handle groups correctly.
   * Hmean reported an error, when supplied with a NA vector, instead of simply
     returning NA and shut up.
   * Desc.numeric would not always have sorted the whole vector, which in some cases
     resulted in incorrect unique and extreme values.
   * StrAlign would not alwas have trimmed white space on the right side.

KNOWN PROBLEMS / TODOS:
   * Leading zeros and big.mark can not be used together in Format.
   * DoCounts should get an O(n log(n)) implementation, containig std. errors.
   * We have not reached our goal yet - documentation is still not finalized, some functions
     not tested thoroughly enough, others have rather a proof of concept status -
     but we are well on our way to achieving it. Systematic check over all
     function interfaces, ensuring consistency with R-standards and DescTools
     conventions will be performed next.

DEFUNCT:
   * WrdTable will now do the job of old WrdAddTable.
